# Honeymoon

We are planning a once-in-a-lifetime honeymoon to Sicily this summer. We will be traveling with [Seable Holidays](https://seable.co.uk){:target="_blank"}, a company that specializes in thoughtfully curated trips for visually impaired travelers. What makes Seable Holidays so special is their commitment to providing a dedicated local guide throughout the journey. This guide offers rich descriptions of each experience, assistance in restaurants and shopping, language support, and transportation—allowing travelers to fully immerse themselves in the culture, beauty, and history of Sicily.

Because of this personalized level of care, the trip is more costly, but it ensures an unforgettable and accessible experience. If you would like to contribute to this meaningful honeymoon, gifts can be sent via Zelle to Vee’s phone number or via [Venmo @Vee-Gaspa](https://venmo.com/u/Vee-Gaspa){:target="_blank"}. Please include “honeymoon” in the memo.

They also have many other trips all throughout Europe and other places around the world.

We are so grateful for your love and support and cannot wait to celebrate our new marriage together in Sicily.
